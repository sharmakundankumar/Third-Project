              <p>
                Investment is the dedication of an asset to attain an increase
                in value over a period of time. Investment requires a sacrifice
                of some present asset, such as time, money, or effort.

                  A fixed deposit (FD) is a financial instrument provided by banks or NBFCs which provides investors a higher rate of interest than a regular savings account, until the given maturity date. It may or may not require the creation of a separate account. It is known as a term deposit or time deposit in Canada, Australia, New Zealand,fixed deposit in India and the United States, and as a bond in the United Kingdom and for a fixed deposit is that the money cannot be withdrawn from the FD as compared to a recurring deposit or a demand deposit before maturity. Some banks may offer additional services to FD holders such as loans against FD certificates at competitive interest rates. It's important to note that banks may offer lesser interest rates under uncertain economic conditions. The interest rate varies between 4 and 7.50 percent. The tenure of an FD can vary from 7, 15 or 45 days to 1.5 years and can be as high as 10 years. These investments are safer than Post Office Schemes as they are covered by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC). However, DICGC guarantees amount up to ₹ 500000(about $6850) per depositor per bank. They also offer income tax and wealth tax benefits.

                  In finance,
                  <br />A stock market, equity market, or share market is the
                  aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks (also called
                  shares), which represent ownership claims on businesses; these
                  may include securities listed on a public stock exchange, as
                  well as stock that is only traded privately, such as shares of
                  private companies which are sold to investors through equity
                  crowdfunding platforms. Investment is usually made with an
                  investment strategy in mind. Stocks can be categorized by the
                  country where the company is domiciled. For example, Nestlé
                  and Novartis are domiciled in Switzerland and traded on the
                  SIX Swiss Exchange, so they may be considered as part of the
                  Swiss stock market, although the stocks may also be traded on
                  exchanges in other countries, for example, as American
                  depositary receipts (ADRs) on U.S. stock markets.

                <h3>Mutual fund</h3>
                <p>
                  In finance,
                  <br />A mutual fund is a professionally managed investment
                  fund that pools money from many investors to purchase
                  securities. The term is typically used in the United States,
                  Canada, and India, while similar structures across the globe
                  include the SICAV in Europe ('investment company with variable
                  capital') and open-ended investment company (OEIC) in the UK.
                  Mutual funds are often classified by their principal
                  investments: money market funds, bond or fixed income funds,
                  stock or equity funds, or hybrid funds.
                  <br /> Funds may also be
                  categorized as index funds, which are passively managed funds
                  that track the performance of an index, such as a stock market
                  index or bond market index, or actively managed funds, which
                  seek to outperform stock market indices but generally charge
                  higher fees. Primary structures of mutual funds are open-end
                  funds, closed-end funds, unit investment trusts. Open-end
                  funds are purchased from or sold to the issuer at the net
                  asset value of each share as of the close of the trading day
                  in which the order was placed, as long as the order was placed
                  within a specified period before the close of trading. They
                  can be traded directly with the issuer.<br /> Mutual funds have
                  advantages and disadvantages compared to direct investing in
                  individual securities. The advantages of mutual funds include
                  economies of scale, diversification, liquidity, and
                  professional management.<br /> However, these come with mutual
                  fund fees and expenses. Mutual funds are regulated by
                  governmental bodies and are required to publish information
                  including performance, comparison of performance to
                  benchmarks, fees charged, and securities held. A single mutual
                  fund may have several share classes by which larger investors
                  pay lower fees. Hedge funds and exchange-traded funds are not
                  mutual funds.
